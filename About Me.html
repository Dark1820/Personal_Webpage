            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Zac Castaneda, a recent graduate of Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi, where I earned my degree in Computer Science with a focus on Systems Programming. Over the course of my academic journey, I have developed a deep passion for technology, specializing in software engineering, artificial intelligence, and GIS mapping. My experience spans programming in languages such as C, C++, Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Python, as well as Unix and Linux.</p>
                <p>During my time as a student, I had the opportunity to work as an AI Policy Intern at the Office of State Representative Todd Hunter, where I conducted research and contributed to policy analysis on the societal impacts of artificial intelligence. I also gained hands-on experience in GIS mapping and 3D modeling through a GIS Research Study at Texas A&M, where I worked on spatial analysis and advanced mapping techniques.</p>

        <p>In addition to my technical background, I served as the Vice President of Communications for Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity, where I led efforts to improve member engagement and streamline communications strategies.</p>

        <p>Now, as a recent graduate, I’m excited to bring my skills and experiences into the tech industry. I’m passionate about merging creativity and technology to build solutions that have a meaningful impact, whether it’s developing innovative software, advancing AI research, or improving GIS applications.
